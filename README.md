# Thesis Work


This repository contains the simulation codes along with the theoretical results and proofs for the thesis based on
2 stge sampling. The codes will be updated as soon as I'm done with the coding.


**Rough Idea**

- The first idea is to create a simple simulation example where we have a single medication and our parameter of interest is to compiute the average causal effect of that treatment.


The rest of the things will be updated as soon as the works are completed.
